      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "In orthographic projection, a point is represented by its projections on two reference planes (Horizontal Plane and Vertical Plane). These projections appear as the intersection of two perpendicular lines when the planes are unfolded."

      },
      "explanations": {

      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "A projector is an imaginary line that is drawn perpendicular from the object (point, line, or surface) to the projection plane. It serves as the path along which the projection is made, ensuring accurate orthographic representation."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "In the 2nd quadrant, the Vertical Plane (VP) is positioned behind the Horizontal Plane (HP). When the planes are unfolded for drawing, the upper part of VP appears above the XY line, maintaining the spatial relationship."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Orthographic projection is a method of representing 3D objects on 2D planes by projecting views perpendicular to reference planes (typically Vertical Plane and Horizontal Plane). This ensures true shape and size representation without distortion."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "In the 1st quadrant, after rotation and unfolding of the planes, the Horizontal Plane (HP) folds downward about the XY line. Therefore, the front part of HP appears below the XY line in the final drawing layout."
