### Procedure

#### Experiment 1- 40 mm in front of VP and 20 mm above HP
1. The point lies in the first quadrant. 
2. Draw the XY line and draw a projector at any point on it.  
3. To draw the front view, mark a’ 20 mm above XY on the projector.
4. To draw the top view, mark a 40 mm below XY on the same projector.

#### Experiment 2- 40 mm behind VP and 25 mm above HP
1. The point lies in the second quadrant. 
2. Draw the XY line and draw a projector at any point on it.  
3. To draw the front view, mark b’ 25 mm above XY on the projector.
4. To draw the top view, mark b 40 mm above XY on the same projector.

#### Experiment 3- 45 mm behind VP and 30 mm below HP
1. The point lies in the third quadrant.
2. Draw the XY line and draw a projector at any point on it.   
3. To draw the front view, mark c’ 30 mm below XY on the projector.
4. To draw the top view, mark c 45 mm above XY on the same projector.

#### Experiment 4- 35 mm in front of VP and 40 mm below HP
1. The point lies in the fourth quadrant.
2. Draw the XY line and draw a projector at any point on it.   
3. To draw the front view, mark d’ 40 mm below XY on the projector.
4. To draw the top view, mark d 35 mm below XY on the projector.
